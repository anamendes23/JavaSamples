/* The CaesarBreaker class implements an algorithm to decrypt a message encrypted using
 * Caesar Cipher encryption method without knowing the key.
 * The logic is to rely on letter frequencies in English.
 * In this case, we assumed that 'e' is the most frequent letter. Therefore, the 
 * decryption method will look for the most frequent letter and assume it is 'e',
 * to then calculate the key and attempt to decryp the message.
